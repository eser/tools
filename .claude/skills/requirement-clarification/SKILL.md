# requirement-clarification

## Quick Start

1. Identify ambiguity -> Formulate specific questions -> Ask before implementing
2. Ask about scope, edge cases, and trade-offs when unclear
3. Propose options with trade-offs when multiple approaches exist
4. Never assume - verify critical decisions with user

## Key Principles

- **Ask early**: Clarify before writing code, not after
- **Be specific**: Ask targeted questions, not vague ones
- **Offer options**: Present 2-3 approaches with trade-offs
- **Batch questions**: Group related questions together
- **Know when NOT to ask**: Skip for trivial/obvious decisions

## When to Ask

- Multiple valid implementations exist
- Business logic implications unclear
- Scope boundaries undefined
- Breaking changes possible
- Security/performance trade-offs involved
